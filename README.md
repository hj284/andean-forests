# Andean forests
The purpose of this site is to showcase ambiances of South America's Andean ecoregion, where cloud forests meet the Amazon jungle. Immerse yourself in our planet's most biodiverse region through authentic nature ambiances captured on location in high definition audio. Navigate between the three pages to experience the sound and feel of a dawn chorus in the cloud forest of the high Andes, followed by an orchid-drenched riverbank that winds its way down from the mountains to the humid jungles below, finally leading to a nightime soundscape of the wild Amazon rainforest.

Ambiances consist of both visual and audio media, so please make sure your volume is turned on!
